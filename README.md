# Project 3: frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

Project 3 is a classic arcade game clone that lets the user play a **Frogger** style
game on their computer.

# Quckstart

## Install

`Fork` the repository `https://github.com/galeazzij/p3-frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git`
and then open the file on your computer via your browser called **index.html**

## Game Play

The player will initialize when the page is loaded.  The object of the game is to get the player to the water at the top of the screen.  If the player reaches the water then the player be reset at the bottom again.  If the player gets **hit** by one of the bugs then then player will be reset to the starting point on the bottom of the playing board.

## Future upgrades

I plan on adding the following features at a later date:

* A score keeper
* Limited lives
* A timer
* The ability to choose your own character
* The ability to progress through levels that get harder as you keep winning
